# Hardware-implementation-of-a-Frequency-Modulator-using-CORDIC-algorithm
This project describes frequency modulation of a signal by hardware realization of a sine wave generator using CORDIC algorithm. CORDIC algorithm is used to compute the values of typical mathematical functions of sine and cosine. This is implemented on FPGA using Verilog and the sine output is given to Digital to Analog converter (DAC) to generate a sinusoidal wave. The analog output is fed into a Digital Storage Oscilloscope (DSO) in order to verify the sine wave output. The sine wave generated acts as a carrier wave for frequency modulation of a given signal which has huge applications in communication systems.
